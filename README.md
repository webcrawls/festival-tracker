# Festival Tracker

**Festival Tracker** is a data visualization tool created to explore the Fortnite Festival track list. One can explore
the available tracks, and sort by various categories.

Built with svelte and fuse.js.

## Motivation

I really like Fortnite Festival, I think it has potential to be one of the best rhythm games, but it still leaves a bit to be desired. One pain point is the in-game UI makes it difficult to view and sort
tracks by difficulty, which is something I believe is very important in a rhythm game.

I hope this project can act as a stop-gap solution while the Festival team works on updates and improvements. And I hope
to learn and improve on my knowledge of some technologies for myself.

## Technologies

- Svelte for the front-end
- fuse.js for fussy searching
- Selenium for webscraping fortnite.fandom.com.

## TODO

- Cleaner styling
- Explore grabbing song data from Fortnite APIs directly
