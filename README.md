# Festival Tracker

**Festival Tracker** is a data visualization tool created to explore the Fortnite Festival track list. One can explore
the available tracks, and sort by various categories.

Built with svelte and fuse.js.

## Motivation

I really like Fortnite Festival, I think it has potential to be one of the best rhythm games, but there are a few areas
where a definite improvement needs to be made. One pain point is the in-game UI makes it difficult to view and sort all
tracks based by difficulty, which is something I believe is very important in a rhythm game.

I hope this project can act as a stop-gap solution while the Festival team works on updates and improvements. And I hope
to learn and improve on my knowledge of some technologies for myself.

## Technologies
- Svelte for the front-end
- fuse.js for fussy searching
- Selenium for webscraping fortnite.fandom.com. (I haven't figured out what API the client pulls from yet, and I would like to cut my teeth
on Selenium.)
